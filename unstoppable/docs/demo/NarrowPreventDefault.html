<p>
    Click on the text to see the default action being prevented from inside the shadowDom of a slotting web component.
    If you click on the arrow of the first summary, this click is not captured by the bombs-away element, and
    thus will as expected let the default action through.
</p>
<div>
    This illustrates the bomb, global nature of preventDefault. The global property of preventDefault reverses the flow
    of control from the outside lightDOM context (the user of the web component)
    to the inner shadowDOM context (the web component being used).
